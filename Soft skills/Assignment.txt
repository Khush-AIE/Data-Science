Subject	Thank You!!
Dear Ram,
Thank you very much for the watch you sent me on my birthday last week. I am really obliged to receive it. The main thing I liked about the watch is it shows date and day along with time. Additionally, the color of the digits is quite attractive and sporty. The band of the watch is very flexible and relaxing to wear. Moreover it helps me in the gym during my workout to calculate the calories and steps.
 Overall it was one of the best gifts I have ever received.
Thanks again!

Best regards

I would like to sincerely apologize for my absence in the meeting. I tried my best to reach there on time but due to a medical emergency occurring at my house I was unable to space out the time for the meeting.
I hope you will find my reason genuine and understand the situation. I will take all the necessary steps to conclude the discussion as soon as I arrive at the office.
Once again Iâ€™m truly sorry and appreciate your time and consideration.

Q3. Reminder email
	To: xyz@gmail.com
	Subject: Gentle reminder!
	Dear Sir,
Seven days ago I visited your site and explored it along with the staff members who were present over there. I made  a formal confirmation to them about the place and they told me that I will be provided with the templates in 2 days. But I am afraid to tell you that I have not received the documents yet.
It would be very helpful for me if you look at this and provide me with the required templates so that I can take further steps.
Best regards,
