Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope you are doing well. I would like to sincerely apologize for my absence from the meeting scheduled on 20th June 2025. I understand how important the discussion was, and I truly regret not being able to attend.

Unfortunately, I was faced with an unexpected medical emergency at home involving a close family member, which required my immediate attention.

I will make it a priority to review any shared notes or updates from the meeting and catch up on any pending actions. If needed, I would be happy to schedule a quick follow-up to ensure I am aligned with the decisions made. Thank you for your understanding and patience.

Best regards,
Vyas Khush
