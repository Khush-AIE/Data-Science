    st.markdown("""The human brain is the complex, 3-pound command center of the nervous system, responsible for intelligence, memory, emotion, touch, motor skills, and autonomous body functions like breathing. It consists of roughly 86-100 billion neurons—specialized cells communicating via electrical signals—and is divided into the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem.\n

Key Anatomical Structures and Functions
\n- Cerebrum (Forebrain): The largest part, divided into left/right hemispheres and four lobes responsible for high-level tasks:
\n- Frontal Lobe: Reasoning, planning, motor skills, and speech (Broca's area).
\n- Parietal Lobe: Processing sensory information like touch, temperature, and pain.
\n- Temporal Lobe: Auditory processing, language understanding (Wernicke's area), and memory.
\n- Occipital Lobe: Interpreting visual input.
\n- Cerebellum: Located under the cerebrum, it coordinates voluntary muscle movements, balance, and posture.
\n- Brainstem: Connects the cerebrum and cerebellum to the spinal cord, controlling automatic survival functions like breathing, heart rate, and sleep cycles. 

\n** Brain Composition and Characteristics
\n- Cells: Composed of neurons (information processors) and glia (support cells).
\n- Composition: Approximately 
water, with gray matter (neuron bodies) and white matter (axons).
\n- Development: Continues developing until the late 40s. 

\n** Core Functions
\n- The brain processes, integrates, and coordinates information, acting as the body's central controller. It receives sensory inputs, initiates movements, and regulates emotions and cognitive processes.""")
